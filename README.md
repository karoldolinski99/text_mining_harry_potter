# text_mining_harry_potter

The aim of the work is to analyze two selected books written by J.K. Rowling:

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Volume IV,
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - Volume VI.

The study includes word count analysis, TFIDF (term frequency inverse document frequency), as well as sentiment analysis. An important stage of the work is the construction of a classification model, the purpose of which will be to indicate which book a given fragment of the text comes from. 

The data comes from https://github.com/sharanyavb/harry-potter/tree/master/Books_Text and was retrieved on January 5, 2023. Each row in the dataframe represents one line from the book.
